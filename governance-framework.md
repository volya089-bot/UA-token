# VolyaChain Governance Framework

## Overview

VolyaChain implements a comprehensive governance system that allows token holders to control the protocol's evolution, including the unique multi-token creation capabilities and owner allocation mechanisms.

## Governance Token (UA)

### Voting Power
- **Base Power**: 1 UA = 1 vote
- **Quadratic Scaling**: âˆš(token_amount) for large holders to prevent plutocracy
- **Delegation**: Token holders can delegate voting power
- **Lock-up Bonus**: Additional voting power for locked tokens

### Proposal Requirements
- **Minimum Threshold**: 50,000 UA to create proposals
- **Proposal Fee**: 1,000 UA (refunded if proposal passes)
- **Voting Period**: 7 days
- **Execution Delay**: 2 days (timelock)
- **Quorum**: 10% of circulating supply

## Governance Scope

### Protocol Parameters
- Block reward amounts and distribution
- Halving schedule modifications
- Owner allocation percentage (currently 20%)

- Validator requirements and slashing conditions

### Token Creation Governance
- Token creation fees (currently 100 UA)
- NFT minting fees (currently 10 UA)

## Proposal Types

### 1. Parameter Changes
```
Title: Adjust Token Creation Fee
Description: Reduce token creation fee from 100 UA to 50 UA

Execution: Update TokenFactory contract parameters
```

### 2. Protocol Upgrades
```
Title: Add New Token Standard VC-2077
Description: Implement advanced NFT standard with dynamic properties
Impact: Enhanced NFT capabilities for developers
Execution: Deploy new contracts and update factory
```

### 3. Treasury Spending
```
Title: Ecosystem Development Grant
Description: Allocate 1M UA for DeFi protocol development
Impact: Attract new projects to VolyaChain
Execution: Transfer funds to multisig wallet
```

### 4. Emergency Actions
```
Title: Pause Token Creation Due to Exploit
Description: Temporarily halt new token creation pending security review
Impact: Protect users from potential vulnerabilities
Execution: Call pause() on factory contracts
```

## Voting Mechanisms

### Standard Voting
- **For/Against/Abstain**: Simple majority wins
- **Minimum Participation**: 10% quorum required
- **Vote Timing**: 7 days from proposal submission
- **Execution**: Automatic after 2-day timelock

### Quadratic Voting
- **Vote Cost**: Quadratic scaling (1 vote = 1 UA, 2 votes = 4 UA, etc.)
- **Use Cases**: Important protocol changes, funding decisions
- **Benefits**: Reduces influence of large holders
- **Credits**: Distributed quarterly to all token holders

### Conviction Voting
- **Continuous**: No fixed voting periods
- **Conviction Build**: Longer support = more weight
- **Use Cases**: Ongoing funding streams, long-term initiatives
- **Implementation**: Funding pools with conviction requirements

## DAO Structure

### Core Teams

#### Protocol Team
- **Role**: Technical development and maintenance
- **Members**: 7 elected developers
- **Term**: 2 years with staggered elections
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Smart contract development
  - Security audits and monitoring
  - Technical proposal review

#### Treasury Team

  - Proposal formatting and review
  - Community education and outreach
  - Conflict resolution

### Multisig Wallets

#### Treasury Multisig
- **Signers**: 7 (4 of 7 required)
- **Composition**: 3 Treasury Team + 2 Protocol Team + 2 Community
- **Controls**: Main treasury funds, grant distributions
- **Limits**: Maximum 5% of treasury per month without governance

#### Emergency Multisig
- **Signers**: 5 (3 of 5 required)
- **Composition**: Core developers and security experts
- **Controls**: Emergency pause functions, security patches

#### Owner Allocation Multisig
- **Signers**: 9 (5 of 9 required)
- **Composition**: Original owner + 8 community representatives
- **Controls**: 20% owner allocation from block rewards and minting
- **Usage**: Ecosystem development, strategic investments

## Decision Making Process

### Phase 1: Discussion (5 days)
1. **Forum Post**: Proposer creates detailed discussion thread
2. **Community Input**: Stakeholders provide feedback and suggestions
3. **Technical Review**: Protocol team assesses implementation feasibility
4. **Economic Analysis**: Treasury team evaluates financial impact

### Phase 2: Formal Proposal (2 days)
1. **Proposal Submission**: Create on-chain proposal with refined details
2. **Stake Requirement**: Deposit 50,000 UA as proposal bond
3. **Technical Validation**: Automated checks for proposal validity
4. **Publication**: Proposal published to governance portal

### Phase 3: Voting (7 days)
1. **Voting Opens**: Token holders can vote For/Against/Abstain
2. **Delegation**: Non-participating holders' votes follow delegates
3. **Real-time Tracking**: Live vote counts and participation metrics
4. **Final 24 Hours**: Last chance for vote changes

### Phase 4: Execution (2+ days)
1. **Timelock Period**: 2-day delay for security review
2. **Implementation**: Automated execution of approved proposals
3. **Monitoring**: Track implementation results and impacts
4. **Follow-up**: Community assessment of outcomes

## Special Governance Features

### Owner Allocation Governance
Given the unique 20% allocation to the original owner, special governance mechanisms ensure this power is used responsibly:

#### Allocation Committee
- **Composition**: 3 owner representatives + 6 community representatives
- **Mandate**: Oversee use of owner allocation funds
- **Transparency**: Monthly reports on allocation usage
- **Constraints**: Cannot use more than 1% per month without governance approval

#### Community Veto
- **Threshold**: 25% of token holders can veto owner allocation decisions
- **Process**: 3-day challenge period for any allocation over 100,000 UA
- **Effect**: Forces community vote on contested allocations
- **Override**: Owner can override veto with 60% governance approval

### Multi-Token Governance
Each token created on VolyaChain can implement its own governance:

#### Token-Specific DAOs
- **Creation**: Automatic DAO setup for tokens over 1M supply
- **Integration**: Connected to main VolyaChain governance
- **Independence**: Can set own parameters within protocol limits
- **Inheritance**: Inherits security and infrastructure from main chain

#### Cross-Token Voting
- **Federation**: Multiple token DAOs can form voting federations
- **Weighted Power**: Voting power based on token market cap
- **Collective Decisions**: Shared infrastructure and protocol upgrades
- **Dispute Resolution**: Main VolyaChain governance as final arbiter

## Governance Evolution

### Adaptive Parameters
The governance system can modify its own parameters through the standard proposal process:

- **Quorum Requirements**: Adjustable based on participation trends
- **Voting Periods**: Can be extended for complex proposals
- **Threshold Amounts**: Dynamic based on token price and supply
- **Committee Structure**: Expandable as ecosystem grows

### Future Enhancements
- **Prediction Markets**: Betting on proposal outcomes
- **AI-Assisted Analysis**: Automated impact assessment
- **Cross-Chain Governance**: Multi-blockchain coordination
- **Liquid Democracy**: Dynamic delegation systems

## Implementation Timeline
